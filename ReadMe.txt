This was used in my first company for SASA based AMS project

Where every time creating the new page for evey new tenant was a tedious process and time taking.

The Helped to create the Dynamic Page by selecting the fields required from the list of fields for Candidate and Job page.Along with 10 additional custom fields which can be mapped to the DB.


On selection of the fields with the required order and validation rule the Html was generated on go. The Html was then take and created new page with Css changes add.

On submit it generates the Json object (i.e. 2 way Data bind sort of) without any additional code.

Even the data was binned from the Json object to the from  fields without any additional code.

This was big hit for the Ams, Which saved lot of developer, QA efforts and time, deployment effort.

This code on Git hug doesn’t be possible to run, Due to Dependency with rest service and DB.
